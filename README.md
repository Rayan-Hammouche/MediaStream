# MediaStream

<p>
  Welcome to MediaStream, a mini-netflix website with every movies in earth repertoried. This website was initied by the end of my Netflix subscription, so I decided to create    my own movie platform.

  This website is not yet finished and only 24.6% of the job is done, but I think it will be amazing at the end. But you can show the advancements in the files. This site will contain all the movies in 3 languages: English, French and Chinese. I work actually in the English version. This is for me my first uploaded website in Github. I used plain javascript for creating dynamic component that willrender the page and API to retrieve the informations from a database.

 I hope you will enjoy this website, it will took me a long time to realize it. The app is composed only by core concepts in HTML, CSS and plain JavaScript!

 Thank
